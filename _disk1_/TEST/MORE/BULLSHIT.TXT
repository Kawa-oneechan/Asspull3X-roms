This is bullshit, you know.
This is another line.

Here's a really long line that spans a total of 132 characters. Since the screen is only 80 characters wide, this ought to be good.

It should've cut that long line off at "screen".
If all goes well it should scroll them as separate lines!

The rest of this is just filler.
I'll throw in some King's Quest I guess...

You may be tempted to (at some point) throw out the
Guidebook.  This is a warning not to, however.  This
guide contains detailed instructions to get past
certain points in the game.  You will not be able
to pass these points without the guide.

Q: "I start KQ6 and get a message that says I need more memory,
but I've got 8 megabytes of memory.  What's wrong?"
A: No matter how much memory you have installed, DOS is
designed to use only the first 640K of RAM.  Make and use a boot
disk.  The only way we can use all the memory in your computer is
to run KQ6 as a Windows application.  To play King's Quest VI, we
require that you have 589,000 bytes of available base memory. 

You cannot use saved games from the Windows when playing under
DOS, and vice-versa.  If you try, you'll get a message "THAT GAME 
WAS SAVED UNDER A DIFFERENT INTERPRETER."  Saved games
from a small installation cannot be used with a large installation, and
vice versa.

As with other Windows applications, installing King's Quest 6 will update
your SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files.  If you want to immediately restore
your system environment after installing KQ6 CD-ROM, we took the added 
precaution of backing up your original WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files 
into the \SIERRA\KQ6CD directory.  The WIN.INI file is renamed KQ6.WIN, 
and SYSTEM.INI is renamed KQ6.INI.  Normally there is no need to restore
these files, since these files are constantly updated every time you use
Windows.  Do not copy and rename these files to the WINDOWS directory a 
few days, weeks, etc. after installing KQ6, or you'll lose the changes 
made after installing KQ6.
