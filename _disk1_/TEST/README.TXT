WINDOWS USERS:

We highly recommend that you turn your screen savers
OFF while playing King's Quest VI.  If you are in
the middle of a conversation with a character
and your screen saver kicks in, you may
experience audio break ups, and other problems.

GUIDEBOOK TO THE LAND OF THE GREEN ISLES:

You may be tempted to (at some point) throw out the
Guidebook.  This is a warning not to, however.  This
guide contains detailed instructions to get past
certain points in the game.  You will not be able
to pass these points without the guide.
